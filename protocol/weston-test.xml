      Internal testing facilities for the weston compositor.

      It can't be stressed enough that these should never ever be used
      outside of running weston's tests.  The weston-test.so module should
      never be installed.

      These requests may allow clients to do very bad things.

  <interface name="weston_test_runner" version="1">
    <description summary="weston internal testing">
      This is a global singleton interface for Weston internal tests.

      This interface allows a test client to trigger compositor-side
      test procedures. This is useful for cases, where the actual tests
      are in compositor plugins, but they also require the presence of
      a particular client.

      This interface is implemented by the compositor plugins containing
      the testing code.

      A test client starts a test with the "run" request. It must not send
      another "run" request until receiving the "finished" event. If the
      compositor-side test succeeds, the "finished" event is sent. If the
      compositor-side test fails, the compositor should send the protocol
      error "test_failed", but it may also exit with an error (e.g. SEGV).

      Unknown test name will raise "unknown_test" protocol error.
